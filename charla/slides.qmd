Welcome to my talk: Avoiding deaths by powerpoint - Data Storytelling and Python to the rescue.

Just to be fair, deaths by powerpoint are not caused by the software. It's the speaker that lacks data storytelling tools and skills to make it more engaging!

Stories are 

the first human technology

:::{.notes}
People have been telling stories since the begining, because it's just the way our brains work. 
[click]
It's a "built-in technology" because it allows for knowledge transmission. 
It allows collective learning and cooperation at small and large scale.

Stories are not a random collection of facts. There's a very specific order: start, conflict, conflict resolution, ending. 
That's the pattern that the brain craves, because it can learn from it. That's why we consume so much stories in any form: books, comics, tv-series, movies, etcetera.
So, what do you do when you know how something works? You hack it, of course!
